  abstract = {With the advent of big data phenomenon in the world of data and its related technologies, the developments on the NoSQL databases are highly regarded. It has been claimed that these databases outperform their SQL counterparts. The aim of this study is to investigate the claim by evaluating the document-oriented MongoDB database with SQL in terms of the performance of common aggregated and non-aggregate queries. We designed a set of experiments with a huge number of operations such as read, write, delete, and select from various aspects in the two databases and on the same data for a typical e-commerce schema. The results show that MongoDB performs better for most operations excluding some aggregate functions. The results can be a good source for commercial and non-commercial companies eager to change the structure of the database used to provide their line-of-business services.},

Similarly, big data applications are software and systems utilizing large and complex datasets to extract insights, support decision-making, and address diverse business and societal challenges. Recently, the significance of big data applications has grown immensely for organizations across diverse sectors as they increasingly rely on insights derived from data. The increasing reliance on data insights has rendered traditional technologies and platforms inefficient due to scalability limitations and performance issues. This study contributes by identifying key domains impacted by big data, examining its effect on decision-making, addressing inherent complexities and opportunities, exploring core technologies, and offering solutions for potential concerns. Additionally, it conducts a comparative analysis to demonstrate the superiority of this research. These contributions provide valuable insights into the evolving landscape shaped by big data applications.},

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

NoSQL databases are characterized by horizontal scalability, schema-free data models, and easy cloud deployment. To avoid overprovisioning, it is essential to be able to identify the correct number of nodes required for a specific system before deployment. This paper benchmarks and compares three of the most common NoSQL databases: Cassandra, MongoDB and HBase. We deploy them on the Amazon EC2 cloud platform using different types of virtual machines and cluster sizes to study the effect of different configurations. We then compare the behavior of these systems to high-level queueing network models. Our results show that the models are able to capture the main performance characteristics of the studied databases and form the basis for a capacity planning tool for service providers and service users.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Despite the lack of consensus on an official definition of Big Data, research and studies have continued to progress based on this “no consensus” stance over the years. However, the lack of a clear definition and scope for Big Data results in scientific research and communication lacking a common ground. Even with the popular “V” characteristics, Big Data remains elusive. The term is broad and is used differently in research, often referring to entirely different concepts, which is rarely stated explicitly in papers. While many studies and reviews attempt to draw a comprehensive understanding of Big Data, there has been little systematic research on the position and practical implications of the term Big Data in research environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on secondary studies to provide a comprehensive overview of how Big Data is used and understood across different scientific domains. Our objective was to monitor the application of the Big Data concept in science, identify which technologies are prevalent in which fields, and investigate the discrepancies between the theoretical understanding and practical usage of the term. Our study found that various Big Data technologies are being used in different scientific fields, including machine learning algorithms, distributed computing frameworks, and other tools. These manifestations of Big Data can be classified into four major categories: abstract concepts, large datasets, machine learning techniques, and the Big Data ecosystem. This study revealed that despite the general agreement on the “V” characteristics, researchers in different scientific fields have varied implicit understandings of Big Data. These implicit understandings significantly influence the content and discussions of studies involving Big Data, although they are often not explicitly stated. We call for a clearer articulation of the meaning of Big Data in research to facilitate smoother scientific communication.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The BigDAWG polystore seeks to provide a mechanism to allow applications to transparently achieve the benefits of diverse databases while insulating applications from the details of these databases. Associative arrays provide a common approach to the mathematics found in different databases: sets (SQL), graphs (NoSQL), and matrices (NewSQL). This work presents the SQL relational model in terms of associative arrays and identifies the key mathematical properties that are preserved within SQL. These properties include associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identities, annihilators, and inverses. Performance measurements on distributivity and associativity show the impact these properties can have on associative array operations. These results demonstrate that associative arrays could provide a mathematical model for polystores to optimize the exchange of data and execution queries.},

SQL databases were created to organize data and allow for horizontal expansion. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, support horizontal scalability and can efficiently process large amounts of unstructured data. Organizational needs determine which paradigm is appropriate, yet selecting the best option is not always easy. Differences in database design are what set SQL and NoSQL databases apart. Each NoSQL database type also consistently employs a mixed-model approach. Therefore, it is challenging for cloud users to transfer their data among different cloud storage services (CSPs). There are several different paradigms being monitored by the various cloud platforms (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and DBaaS). The purpose of this SLR is to examine the articles that address cloud data portability and interoperability, as well as the software architectures of SQL and NoSQL databases. Numerous studies comparing the capabilities of SQL and NoSQL of databases, particularly Oracle RDBMS and NoSQL Document Database (MongoDB), in terms of scale, performance, availability, consistency, and sharding, were presented as part of the state of the art. Research indicates that NoSQL databases, with their specifically tailored structures, may be the best option for big data analytics, while SQL databases are best suited for online transaction processing (OLTP) purposes.},

Effective management of clinical data and the transformation of the data into structured format for data analysis are therefore challenging issues in electronic health records development. Despite the popularity of relational databases, the scalability of the NoSQL database model and the document-centric data structure of XML databases appear to be promising features for effective clinical data management. In this paper, three database approaches – NoSQL, XML-enabled and native XML – are investigated to evaluate their suitability for structured clinical data. The database query performance is reported, together with our experience in the databases development. The results show that NoSQL database is the best choice for query speed, whereas XML databases are advantageous in terms of scalability, flexibility and extensibility, which are essential to cope with the characteristics of clinical data. While NoSQL and XML technologies are relatively new compared to the conventional relational database, both of them demonstrate potential to become a key database technology for clinical data management as the technology further advances.},

  abstract = {Relational Database and NoSQL are competing types of database models. The former has been in existence since 1979 and the latter since the year 2000. The demands of modern applications especially in web 2.0, 3.0 and big data have made NoSQL a popular database of choice. Choosing an appropriate database model to use is an important decision that developers must make based on the features of a given database model. This paper compares the features of Relational Databases and NoSQL to establish which database is better at supporting demands of modern applications. The paper also brings out the challenges of NoSQL. Finally, the paper concludes by determining whether Relational Databases would completely be replaced by NoSQL database models. The findings revealed that, Relational Databases are based on ACID model which emphasizes better consistency, security and offers a standard query language. However, Relational Databases have poor scalability, weak performance, cost more, face availability challenges when supporting large number of users and handle limited volume of data. NoSQL, on the other hand is based on the BASE model, which emphasizes greater scalability and provides a flexible schema, offers better performance, mostly open source, cheap but, lacks a standard query language and does not provide adequate security mechanisms. Both databases will continue to exist alongside each other with none being better than the other. The choice of the database to use will depend on the nature of the application being developed. Each database type has its own challenges and strengths, with relational database lacking of support for unstructured data while NoSQL lacks standardization and has poor security. Modern applications in web 2.0, 3.0 and big data are well suited to use NoSQL but, there are still many applications that rely on Relational Databases.},

  abstract = {Several data-centric applications today produce and manipulate a large volume of data, the so-called Big Data. Traditional databases, in particular, relational databases, are not suitable for Big Data management. As a consequence, some approaches that allow the definition and manipulation of large relational data sets stored in NoSQL databases through an SQL interface have been proposed, focusing on scalability and availability. This paper presents a comparative analysis of these approaches based on an architectural classification that organizes them according to their system architectures. Our motivation is that wrapping is a relevant strategy for relational-based applications that intend to move relational data to NoSQL databases (usually maintained in the cloud). We also claim that this research area has some open issues, given that most approaches deal with only a subset of SQL operations or give support to specific target NoSQL databases. Our intention with this survey is, therefore, to contribute to the state-of-art in this research area and also provide a basis for choosing or even designing a relational-to-NoSQL data wrapping solution.},

  abstract = {Two decades ago, one of us co-authored a paper commenting on the previous 40 years of data modelling research and development [188]. That paper demonstrated that the relational model (RM) and SQL are the prevailing choice for database management systems (DBMSs), despite efforts to replace either them. Instead, SQL absorbed the best ideas from these alternative approaches.We revisit this issue and argue that this same evolution has continued since 2005. Once again there have been repeated efforts to replace either SQL or the RM. But the RM continues to be the dominant data model and SQL has been extended to capture the good ideas from others. As such, we expect more of the same in the future, namely the continued evolution of SQL and relational DBMSs (RDBMSs). We also discuss DBMS implementations and argue that the major advancements have been in the RM systems, primarily driven by changing hardware characteristics.},

  abstract = {As organizations continue to grapple with the massive influx of data in the era of Big Data, the selection of an appropriate database management system becomes critical for efficient data storage, retrieval, and analytics. This study focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of various NoSQL databases commonly employed in the context of Big Data analytics. The research methodology involves the creation of a controlled experimental environment to simulate real-world scenarios, ensuring a fair and unbiased comparison. We consider prominent NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis, examining their capabilities in handling the diverse and complex data structures inherent in Big Data. Key performance metrics include read and write throughput, query response time, scalability, and fault tolerance. The study also explores the impact of data size, structure, and workload characteristics on the databases' performance, providing insights into their suitability for different analytical tasks. Additionally, we analyze the flexibility and ease of integration with popular analytics tools and frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. The ability to seamlessly integrate with these tools is crucial for organizations aiming to derive meaningful insights from their vast datasets. The findings of this study aim to guide enterprises, data architects, and developers in making informed decisions when selecting a NoSQL database for their specific Big Data analytics requirements. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each database in different scenarios, organizations can optimize their data management strategies and enhance the overall efficiency of their analytics pipelines. The comparative analysis presented in this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding NoSQL databases in the context of Big Data analytics, facilitating advancements in data management practices for the benefit of diverse industries.},

  abstract = {We always hear some statements like ‘SQL is outdated’, ‘This is the world of NoSQL’, ‘SQL is still used a lot by most of companies.’ Which one is accurate? Has NoSQL completely replace SQL? Or is NoSQL just a hype? SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard query language for relational database management system. The most popular types of RDBMS(Relational Database Management Systems) like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, uses SQL as their standard database query language.[3] NoSQL means Not Only SQL, which is a collection of non-relational data storage systems. The important character of NoSQL is that it relaxes one or more of the ACID properties for a better performance in desired fields. Some of the NOSQL databases most companies using are Cassandra, CouchDB, Hadoop Hbase, MongoDB. In this paper, we’ll outline the general differences between the SQL and NoSQL, discuss if Relational Database Management Systems is a thing of past, and also compare the speed performance of SQL and NoSQL databases, such as BerkeleyDB, MongoDB and MySQL.},
